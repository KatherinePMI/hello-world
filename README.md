This project is to get me started using Github. The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets one started when learning something new.

Katherine here, I like coding so I'm going to learn how.

Opensource on Github is a good way to go!
Excited about the possibility of becoming a proficient coder :)
